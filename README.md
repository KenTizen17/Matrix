# Matrix

Matrix is an **open-source chatbot** built for **ENSEEIHT INP**.  

The project was created because a previous service promised a chatbot but never delivered. To fill that gap, we decided to **build our own chatbot from scratch**!  

Matrix supports:  
- **Real-time conversation streaming**   
- **Dark mode and responsive UI**  
- **Markdown formatting** for messages
